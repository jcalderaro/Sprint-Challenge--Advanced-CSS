/* Psuedo Code Please Save Me 
- Firstly gotta use Overflow concepts to remove any horizontal scroll bar 
- Maybe we go with like making the outer div or body be width: 100%? Auto?

Then we gotta snatch the two images that are specifically class image unique named
as Sky and and Space and have them go Display: None on the pixel threshold.

Also important thing will be to make sure the paragraphs like, auto space 
to the screen? I feel like they'll do that if I remove the horizontal bar though

Then we need to take the photo Space Walk class and make it stand by itself.
The paragraph Let's Go For A Walk would then go under it, easy

Then just make the button extend to like, 90% width or something because it's not 
entirely the whole page but it's definitely bigger than desktop size.

Then we pass and hit week 3 and life continues

But firstly I should probably test that my media query actually works?
Maybe I'll do like 500px make the whole screen red? Let's try that */
